            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>From 2015, our founders, Alex and Matthew share the same goal and are dedicated to help any cat in need. It is estimated that there is in excess of 200,000 feral cat colonies across Ireland. Since my teeneage years I started to
                volounteer with small local animal shelters. After a few years of practise and a lot of research I did notice something quite odd: dogs are slighly more popular with pet owners. I kept on wondering why? With more years passing every single 
                shelter was getting overcrowded and kittens were not getting enough space and resources for proper care. That's when it hit me. 
                CatFinder is focused on bringing awerness to animal shelter adoptions, to give every single cat and kitty here a second chance at finding a forever loving homes. The more involved I became with animal shelters, 
                I realized exactly how many animals are never given a second chance, and I wanted to try and do everything I could, to help their fate and change them dark statistics. <strong>Because we all deserve a place to belong to.</strong>

            <h1>How we help</h1>
            <p>CatFinder is an independent shelter with it's own volunteers and community, but by no means we work alone! Even as a founder I still participate in as many rescues as I can, personally making sure everything is as safe as possible.  On later stages my fiancee, Matthew came along too.
                We started to collaborate with every shelter I ever volounteered with, starting off with taking more than a half of resident cats there to our centre in Sligo. As of today our office and main building still remains at Ferndale with Cian and Keanan as supervisors, but we have two other facilities: 
                one in Ballina with Matthew in charge and collaborating with any local shelters there, Jamie in Leitrim region and myself, always on my phone. We do have contracts with a few big restaurants and takaways making sure leftovers aren't just tossed to the bins, so we could feed any homeless cats. We are with close contact with six veterinary clinics and some of the very best and dedicated veterinarians. Every few weeks we organise charities 
                events where people can donate their unused pet equipment or food, the only requirement being: good condition or non-expired. For any diffucult rescues we come in greatly prepared with a lot of help with any community member. CatFinder also has an ongoing foster care programme in case we ever run out for space in our facilities, which has been very helpful and sucessful usually leading to adoption. We are known in different neighbourhoods across three counties, possibly even more since our community shares the same goal: help any cat in need. We promise to all of you: we are a fair policy charity and we welcome everyone. 
                We deliver the best possible care to our temporary residents and foster them with great care. <strong>All of the cats are treated with love and respect they deserve.</strong>
